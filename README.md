# Article App

A modern iOS application built with MVVM architecture that integrates with the New York Times APIs to display and search articles.

## Features

- **RxSwift Framework**: Reactive programming for data binding and event handling.
- **NYTimes API Integration**: Uses both Most Popular and Article Search APIs.
- **Home Screen**: Displays app title, search button, and selection for Most Viewed, Most Shared, or Most Emailed articles.
- **Search Screen**: Allows users to search for articles using keywords.
